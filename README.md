# FirstCmp202Project
# This is a Java calculator project. With this calculator, a user can find the following physics methods:
1. Kinetic Energy,
2. Potential Energy,
3. Heat Energy,
4. Work done,
5. Nuclear Energy, and 
6. Thermal Energy.

When the user first opens the calculator, it would ask them what energy problem they want to solve (limited only to the options above). 
Once that is selected, the user will enter the values for whatever they're trying to find the solution to.
EG: Workdone = force * distance
After getting the answer, the user will then be asked if that is all they want to do on the calculator.
If yes, the code stops running.
Otherwise, the user continues to select from the options available to calculate from.

# Thank You!
